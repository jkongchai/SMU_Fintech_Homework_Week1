# Coinbase Case Study

Co-Founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehsam in San Francisco, Coinbase has since become one of the most predominant names in the cryptocurrency market. The first prototype for coinbase was constructed in 2011 and a few months into business, Coinbase was accepted into the prestigious start-up accelerator Y-Combinator. With exposure from this accelerator, Coinbase was viewed as an extremely trustworthy brand for exchanging  crypto which prompted over 20% daily growth in website sign-up, and by 2014 they reached over 1 million sign-ups. Since establishment, the company has raised over $550M from numerous high profile investors such as Andreesen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management, IVP and was the first company in its industry to be valued at more than 1 Billion Dollars (a 'Unicorn'). The idea behind Coinbase began from an article by Satoshi Nakamoto: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" which essentially theorizes the idea of a globally centralized system for moving money/value around.That idea has now become a pillar for the company as you can see from their Vision and Mission statements:

**Vision** : Economic Freedom for every person and business

**Mission** : Create and Open Financial System for the World

To achieve these goals, Coinbase plans to use cryptocurrency along with the smartphone revolution to "inject'' economic freedom into multiple countries globally. The belief is that cryptocurrencies provide multiple benefits for individual user and businesses such as user controlled wallets/brain wallets for property right, cross-border payments to help promote free trade, global payment acceptance/fundraising to start a business (as cryptocurrency has democratized ways in which companies make money and global payments are accepted), stablecoins for currency stability amongst other advantages. 

Today, Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency platform used in the United States with over 56 million verified users, and over 335 billion dollars quarterly volume traded assets. Coinbase operates in over 100 countries and employs more than 1700 employees. The stock COIN(coinbase) is set to debut on NASDAQ direct listing on April 14,2021 at 1:30pm est. 

As mentioned previously, Coinbase is a cryptocurrency platform, and provides multiple services to their users much like their competitors such as Binance, Pionex, and eToro to name a few. Coinbase offers simple, instant buy/sell services on their main platform. 

Coinbase provides services for a variety of clients, and they have split into 3 types: Individuals, Businesses, and Developers. Different services are available for each of these types. Services for individuals range from buying and selling cryptocurrency, the available to earn free crypto, crypto wallet, and card. Businesses have the availability of crypto prime brokerage platforms, crypto asset custody, and online commerce for accepting cryptocurrency as payments. Developers have access to Coinbase Cloud, Coinbase Connect, Coinbase Pro, and additionally have access to Bison Trails, WalletLink, Rosetta, and USDC. With these tools, users have access to easy-to-use API’s, products, secure services, and a reliable infrastructure through Coinbase Cloud for building (Apps). Additional to these services, Coinbase provides a database of education materials easily accessible for all interested parties. They provide all crypto basics, tips and tutorials, and even a detailed tax filing guide for investors.

Now let’s look at some of these services in further detail. Buying/Selling, and earning free cryptocurrency is just that. 

The basic service offered is buying/selling cryptocurrency which is accessible to everyone. Not only that, Coinbase advertises their app decentralized and provides a secure way to store digital assets and “pay friends.” They have also introduced a visa debit card, funding your coinbase balance, as the quickest/easiest way to spend crypto globally. All transaction receipts/ instant notification are provided through the coinbase card app providing simple management of assets. 

Coinbase prime, previously known as Paradex prior to its acquisition by Coinbase, is a brokerage platform offered to Financial Institutions, Institutional Investors, Corporates, and high profile Private Clients providing various investment tools for these clients. Tools like Coinbase Custody (The world’s most trusted cold storage) provides Segregated cold storage, insurance, and other Financial & Security Controls. Lastly, but maybe most importantly, Coinbase offers Coinbase Cloud, a platform and various tools for developers to utilize for building their own apps. There is access to Coinbase Connect ( Coinbase’s API that makes it easy to build and connect your app to over 40 million Coinbase customers, integrate cryptocurrencies, and more), Coinbase Commerce ( a platform, integrated with Woo-Commerce and Shopify, that helps merchants anywhere in the world accept cryptocurrency payments in a fully decentralized way), Coinbase Pro (fully featured trading API offer efficient ways for developers to programmatically build digital asset trading applications), tools such as Bison Trails, Rosetta, WalletLink, and USDC. 

While these are vast services offered catered to specific groups of investors. It would be advantageous for Coinbase to potentially provide a more collaborative environment, similar to eToro, where individuals are able to share their findings, opinions, and strategies. eToro even provides a service for their members to “copy trade” which can be a potential to provide newcomers to the industry a method to piggyback from. Additionally, offering a “virtual” portfolio, like many providers can provide users a visual interpretation of the vast potential of the cryptocurrency market. These can be good learning tools when utilized properly. While Coinbase offers abundant services, there is a lack of tools and simulations for people who still lack the proper knowledge. Establishing rapport with these clients can help with the company’s vision for economic freedom for everyone, because the majority of the population are still uneducated and unsure about this market and the potential. Thus, providing them with a community of like individuals, and a virtual simulation environment could help kickstart their journey. 

Overall, Coinbase has vast potential, and the entry to the stock market just marks a new, bigger journey for the company. With everything that is changing within the past 5 years, or even the past year there is vast new potentials for the cryptocurrency market, and the continuous rise of Coinbase.
